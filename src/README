Two extra data structure were created for this program: LivingEntity and MaximalClique

LivingEntity was created because Persons and Pets had many common methods that
worked in similar ways.

MaximalClique was created to aid in the solving of finding the maximum possible clique. A
MaximalClique is essentially a list of persons in a maximAL clique put into a separate class
so that we wouldn't have nested ArrayLists.
